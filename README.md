# Sleeper UI Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to review my code challenge. Given limited time, I've completed most of what I feel demonstrates my ability, including: 
- an organized file structure conforming to MVC
- translation of JSON data into Swift objects
- use of controllers/managers to handle data, images, and cart functionality
- some UI customization with an original and pleasant visual style

If you download and run the app, you may notice some considerations for real-world use case, such as:
- a confirmation alert when adding to cart from the product list, as it may be easy to tap "add to cart" by accident
- flexible UI which does not display the "View Cart" option until there are actually items in the cart
- in the cart screen, the "clear cart" button is only visible when there are items in the cart
- items can easily be removed from the cart by swiping left on any item
- total price updates with edits to the cart

With more time in a professional setting, I would invest more time into 
- UI polish
- convenience features I wasn't able to get to yet, such as swiping left or right in the product detail page to see the next or previous product
- cleaning up code to make things more concise and easier to navigate
- better error handling, where a lot of places include `fatalError()` for quick development and convenience

I hope this provides some useful insight into my abilities, and I would love to discuss any questions about my work or the decisions made while developing this app. While I wouldn't consider this my best work ever, and I think it could be much improved with more time, my main goal is to give a sense of what I can do without taking or spending too much time to make this perfect.

Thank you again for your time!
